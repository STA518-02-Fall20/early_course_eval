I think for programming, a bunch of demonstrations/lectures isn't very effective, but this course's set up of reading/doing primers before class and then practice has been really good in my opinion. ","I think the learning journals are far too frequent. Honestly it feels like I'm stretching for content a lot because there are only two classes a week. I feel like the class is pretty time consuming with everything else, and the learning journals are just another thing. I definitely understand that they are useful and its good to reflect on what we've learned, I just think too many are required. ","I think one thing I can do better is utilizing more of the tidyverse content and cheatsheets. Also, sometimes in the team activities I may not do a good enough job of understanding everything going on, I just follow the instructions. So I could slow down a bit and try to learn it a bit better, but that is kind of hard in a group setting trying not too get too far behind.","Overall, I really like this course and I feel like I'm learning a lot. However, I think the application from this weekend was pretty rough. I hope that those get better as we move forward. I understand they are supposed to be challenging and prove what we know, but it took a **very** long time and a lot of effort. Maybe having a bit more time to work on them or toning down the difficulty a bit would be helpful. I am definitely spending way more than 6 hours outside of class on coursework, which concerns me going forward because there are still a lot of projects left and more applications."

The book is very good, and the primers and activities supply good practice to go along with the readings.","The first thing I would change would be lowering the learning journal requirement. I am an A student, but I find that I may not be able to get an A in this class solely because of the insane amount of learning journals we are supposed to do. I do not think it should have such a heavy weight on our grade. If we have 2 preparations/week, I think it would make sense to require 2 learning journals/week to get reach an A. ","I think I'm learning a lot, and I understand the material, so I do not have anything I'd change.","I first typed all of this under the question asking what one thing we'd change about the course. Seeing this section, I think it's a more appropriate place to put it:

It's a lot. Activities, preparations, learning journals, applications, projects. I feel that the actual material in this class is not difficult, but I find it very hard to find the time to do everything. This is coming from someone with a full time job, but this course is required for my degree and my degree is supposed to be designed for working professionals. A lot of my time in the activities is helping my group members, so those take up even more time given we need to merge our work when we all finish. I don't know if groups are appropriate for this class - I get along with my group well, but I feel like I'm a tutor for a class I'm currently enrolled in. In addition, only having one day to complete a preparation and follow-up between classes isn't great, and having applications and projects seems redundant. I really do enjoy the material that we are learning in this class. It just seems like a lot of repetitive busy work."

If it is possible to slightly consolidate the coding we do in class, while not compromising too much of our time with other assignments out of class and not missing any content, then that would be perfect. Yet, this could be too much to ask for depending on how adaptable the content/module schedule is.
